Linux - Permissions:


16. Check you can see your new path appended to the end of the path variable
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ echo $PATH

17. If you have Algo1 still created from previous exercises, remove the directory structure and all files within it
(Note: different user name, hence previous directory not available)
However, if it was available, the command would be:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ rmdir Algo1

18. Make a directory named Payment1
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ mkdir Payment1

19. Within Payment1, make three directories named logs, configuration, and scripts
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/Payment1$ mkdir logs configuration scripts

20. Within scripts, create an empty file named start.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/Payment1$ touch scripts/start.sh

21. Within configuration, create an empty file named instance.properties
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/Payment1$ touch configuration/instance.properties

22. Give everyone permission to read the instance.properties file, but assign write and execute permissons only to yourself
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/Payment1$ sudo chmod 744 configuration/instance.properties 

23. Set permissions on the file start.sh so that everyone can execute and so that the group and owner can read and write
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/Payment1$ sudo chmod 771 scripts/start.sh

24. Direct the output of man cat into a file in your home directory named cat.output
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ man cat > cat.output

25. Change the permission of that file so everyone can read it but only the group can write and execute
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ sudo chmod 474 cat.output

26. Go back to your home directory
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cd ~

27. Prove your location
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ pwd
/home/ubuntu

28. Remove the directory Payment1 along with all subdirectories
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ rm -r Payment1

29. Delete the cat.output file, but with a warning first to the user
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ rm -i cat.output

30. Create a directory named temp
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ mkdir temp

31. Set a variable named MYTEMP that references the new temp directory you just created
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ MYTEMP='~/temp'

32. Run a command to see the value of the MYTEMP variable
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ echo $MYTEMP

33. Now set the value of $MYTEMP to nothing
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ env -u MYTEMP

34. Remove the temp directory that you created
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ rmdir temp

35. Run the following command to store your results in the specified directory the trainer gave. Replace the name and date with the correct values:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ history > CarlTangYongHan.220722.module4
### NOTE: I have re-connected my EC2 instance, hence my history chain is broken.
The first part of history is gone.
