Linux - File and Filesystem:


1. Change the directory to your home directory.
$ cd

2. Print out your current directory.
$ pwd

3. Create a folder named Algo1.
$ mkdir Algo1

4. Within Algo1, create subfolders named config, bin, logs, and scripts.
$ mkdir config bin logs scripts

5. Within config, create empty files named config.config and variables.
$ cd config
$ touch config.config variables

6. Within scripts, create empty files named start.sh, stop.sh and admin.sh.
$ cd ../scripts
$ touch start.sh stop.sh admin.sh

7. Within logs, create an empty file named today.log.
$ cd ../logs
$ touch today.log

8. Go back to your home directory.
$ cd

9. Long list everything recursively.
$ ls -lr

10. Remove the file named variables in the config directory.
$ cd Algo1/config
$ rm variables

11. Remove the bin directory that you previously created.
$ cd
$ rmdir Algo1/bin

12. Change back to your home directory.
$ cd

13. Create the bin directory again within Algo1.
$ cd Algo1
$ mkdir bin

14. Create a directory in the logs folder named oldlogs.
$ cd logs
$ mkdir oldlogs

15. Within oldlogs, create folders named 2019, 2018, and 2017.
$ cd oldlogs
$ mkdir 2019 2018 2017

16. Within 2017, create an empty file named 2017.log.
$ cd 2017
$ touch 2017.log

17. Within 2018, create an empty file named 2018.log.
$ cd ../2018
$ touch 2018.log

18. Within 2019, create an empty file named 2019.log.
$ cd ../2019
$ touch 2019.log

19. Change back to your home directory.
$ cd

20. Remove oldlogs using one command.
$ rmdir Algo1/logs/oldlogs

21. Ensure you are in your home directory.
$ cd

22. Search for all files from your home directory that end in .sh.
$ find /home -name *.sh

23. Go into the scripts directory and use a command to remove both the start and stop script without specifying each file separately: rm s*.sh
$ cd Algo1/scripts
$ rm s*.sh

24. Run the following command to store your results in the directory that the trainer has provided â€“ substitute your name and the date in your file.
$ history > CarlTangYongHan.220721.module3


### NOTE: As AWS is too laggy today, I could only write my answers here without actually verifying the commands on a Linux server.
### I also did not actually create any history as in question 24.
