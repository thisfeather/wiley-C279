GitHub Homework 2022-07-28 - Exercise 13 Scripting Exercises

Carl Tang Yong Han

Linux - Scripting Exercises:


For each activity, save your working script to a text file named as:
yourname-scripting-activity#.txt


Activity 1:
Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session – they need to know:

What their username is
What the current date is
What the time is
What their current working directory is
How many files they have in that directory
What is the biggest file in their current directory

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt
_____________________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo This is about your session
echo User Name is `logname`
echo Current Date is `date +%d-%m-%Y`
echo The time is `date +%T`
echo Current working directory is `pwd`
echo Number of files in directory: `ls | wc -l`
echo Biggest file in current directory: `du -ah . | sort -n -r | head -1`
_____________________________________________
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ./CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt 
(Outcome:)
This is about your session
User Name is ubuntu
Current Date is 28-07-2022
The time is 07:46:01
Current working directory is /home/ubuntu
Number of files in directory: 47
Biggest file in current directory: 276K ./logs


Activity 2:
Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty).
Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/scriptingExerciseAct2$ ls
Test1  Test2  Test3

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity2.txt
______________________________
#!/bin/bash

PATH=~/scriptingExerciseAct2

cd $PATH

for  file in *
do
newName="$file.`date +%Y%m%d`"
mv $file $newName
done

cd ~

### NOTE: Debugging unsuccessful, script could not run properly.


Activity 3:
You are in charge of creating a program for the lottery in your area! The options are for numbers between 1 and 50.
Create a script that picks 5 for each draw plus a bonus ball number between 1 and 10. Output the numbers to a file that has the date in its name.
Create another script that will allow users to check their lottery numbers and advise them if they match or not and how many matches they got.

# Keep track of unchosen numbers
leftover=50

# Available numbers in the pool
poolArray=(`seq 1 50`)

# Keep track of unchosen numbers from 1 - 10
remainingOfTen=10

touch luckyDraw

function draw()
{
        # Check leftover pool size:
        leftover=${#poolArray[@]}

        if [ $leftover != 0 ]
        then
                # Randomly pick a number from leftover pool:
                R=$(($RANDOM%$leftover))

                selected=${poolArray[$R]}

                # Check if selected number falls within 1-10
                if [ $selected -ge 1 ] && [ $selected -le 10 ]
                then
                        (( remainingOfTen=remainingOfTen-1 ))
                fi

                # Remove picked number from pool:
                unset poolArray[$R]

                # Produce selected number:
                echo $selected
        fi

# Draw from 1 - 10 if applicable

Activity 4:












Activity 5:
Write a script that takes a number as an input and reverses it out to the user.
For example, if the original number is 74985, the output should be 58947.

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity5.txt
_________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo Please input your number.
read input

# For calculation:
number=$input

# For concatenating string:
numString=""

# Remainder (dynamic):
R=0

while [ $number != 0 ]
do
	R=$((number%10))
	number=$(((number-R)/10))
	numString+="$R"
done

echo Reverted number is: $numString
__________________________________

Example running of script:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ./CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity5.txt
Please input your number.
1234
Reverted number is: 4321
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ./CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity5.txt
Please input your number.
234500
Reverted number is: 005432

Activity 6:
Create a script that takes two number parameters a and b and then shows True if a is larger than b or False otherwise.
Create a second version of the script that then tells the user the difference between the two numbers.
Remember to code defensively – ensure that your script handles things appropriately if someone enters things incorrectly!
