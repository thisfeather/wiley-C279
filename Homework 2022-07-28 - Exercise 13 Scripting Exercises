GitHub Homework 2022-07-28 - Exercise 13 Scripting Exercises

Carl Tang Yong Han

Linux - Scripting Exercises:


For each activity, save your working script to a text file named as:
yourname-scripting-activity#.txt


// Activity 1:
Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session â€“ they need to know:

What their username is
What the current date is
What the time is
What their current working directory is
How many files they have in that directory
What is the biggest file in their current directory

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt
_____________________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo This is about your session
echo User Name is `logname`
echo Current Date is `date +%d-%m-%Y`
echo The time is `date +%T`
echo Current working directory is `pwd`
echo Number of files in directory: `ls | wc -l`
echo Biggest file in current directory: `du -ah . | sort -n -r | head -1`
_____________________________________________
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ./CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt 
(Outcome:)
This is about your session
User Name is ubuntu
Current Date is 28-07-2022
The time is 07:46:01
Current working directory is /home/ubuntu
Number of files in directory: 47
Biggest file in current directory: 276K ./logs


// Activity 2:
Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty).
Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/scriptExerciseAct2$ ls
Test1  Test2  Test3

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity2.txt
______________________________
#!/bin/bash

path=~/scriptExerciseAct2

dateToday=`date +%Y%m%d`

cd $path

for  file in * 
do
newName="$file.$dateToday"
mv "$file" "$newName"
done

cd ~

Outcome:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ls ./scriptExerciseAct2/
Test1.20220729  Test2.20220729  Test3.20220729


// Activity 3:
You are in charge of creating a program for the lottery in your area! The options are for numbers between 1 and 50.
Create a script that picks 5 for each draw plus a bonus ball number between 1 and 10. Output the numbers to a file that has the date in its name.
Create another script that will allow users to check their lottery numbers and advise them if they match or not and how many matches they got.

// Activity 5:
Write a script that takes a number as an input and reverses it out to the user.
For example, if the original number is 74985, the output should be 58947.

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity5.txt
_________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo Please input your number.
read input

# For calculation:
number=$input

# For concatenating string:
numString=""

# Remainder (dynamic):
R=0

while [ $number != 0 ]
do
	R=$((number%10))
	number=$(((number-R)/10))
	numString+="$R"
done

echo Reverted number is: $numString

// Activity 6:
Create a script that takes two number parameters a and b and then shows True if a is larger than b or False otherwise.
Create a second version of the script that then tells the user the difference between the two numbers.
Remember to code defensively â€“ ensure that your script handles things appropriately if someone enters things incorrectly!

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity6.txt
___________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo Please give two parameters a and b
echo Parameter a:
read a
echo Parameter b:
read b

if [ -z "$a" ] || [ -a "$b" ]
then
        echo Inputs contain null value.
        exit 1
fi

regex='^[+-]?[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?$'

if ! [[ $a =~ $regex ]] || ! [[ $b =~ $regex ]]
then
        echo Inputs contain non-number.
        exit 1
fi

if (( a > b ))
then
        echo True, a is larger than b.
else
        echo False, a is not larger than b.

Script Activity6B:
_________________________________
$ cat Activity6B
#!/bin/bash

echo Please give two parameters a and b
echo Parameter a:

// Activity 8:
Create a script that completes the following tasks:
1. It prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
   - The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
   - After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry or enter another number.
2. When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
   - the product of the integers
   - the average of the integers
   - the sum of the integers
   - the min of the integers
   - the max of the integers
3. After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
   - the values the user entered
   - each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value

// Activity 14:
In the materials folder on the server you will find a file called books. Copy this file to your home directory.
Write a script that will parse the file, producing an output csv file that will list the word and each time it appears in the file.
Make sure the list is sorted in the file such that the most common word is listed at the top and then descending.
For example, a couple of lines in the output file should look like this:
   And,200
   Is,195
   
### NOTE: as I am not aware of any materials folder on a common server that students can access,
I am using the data of the Top 500 Novels from: https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat/library100/top500.html

The raw data is kept in a file called "books".

The data looks like this:
___________________________________
1       Don Quixote
2       Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
3       The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
4       The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
7       Wuthering Heights
10      The Scarlet Letter
13      A Christmas Carol
15      A Tale of Two Cities
16      Little Women
17      Great Expectations
18      The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again
19      Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus
20      Oliver Twist
... (followed by the next 480 novels)

// Activity 15:
Imagine that you support the fix Generator script. Write a wrapper script to set up your environment properly.
You can also edit the fixGenerator script if you need to.
Your fixGenerator script should be in a folder called FixGen in your home directory. The script needs to do the following:
 - Check for a folder called FixGen/logs and if not present create it
 - Compress all log files that are not the latest 3 logs files generated.
 - Run the FixGenerator script with the log file being generated into the FixGen/logs directory.
Once complete, add a cron job that will run Monday through Friday 6 a.m. to establish your environment.
Remember to code defensively and ensure that you use exit codes so we know the job has successfully run.
Your script should also output its own log file where we can see the status each step of the way of each part of the script.

## The command "exit 0" was added to fixGenerator, and the file is now called "fixGenerator2.sh".

Script Activity15:
__________________________________


__________________________________

Test running script:
_____________________________
## Show the file structure already created with running the script once,
## along with the log files generated and moved into this folder so far:
Carl@DESKTOP-T2NNS4H MINGW64 ~$ ls FixGen/logs
fixGenerator2.sh*         fixlog20220731162751.log  fixlog20220731175109.log
fixlog20220731161058.log  fixlog20220731163344.log  fixlog20220731181003.log
fixlog20220731162524.log  fixlog20220731164141.log  fixlog20220731183547.log

## Test running the script without generating new log file and without cron scheduling:
## (to test compression of old log files)
Carl@DESKTOP-T2NNS4H MINGW64 ~$ ls FixGen/logs
fixGenerator2.sh*         fixlog20220731181003.log  logArchive.tar
fixlog20220731175109.log  fixlog20220731183547.log

## Look inside archive file:
Carl@DESKTOP-T2NNS4H MINGW64 ~/FixGen/logs$ tar -tvf logArchive.tar
-rw-r--r-- Carl/197121   51509 2022-07-31 16:14 fixlog20220731161058.log
-rw-r--r-- Carl/197121   11517 2022-07-31 16:27 fixlog20220731162524.log
-rw-r--r-- Carl/197121   52439 2022-07-31 16:31 fixlog20220731162751.log
-rw-r--r-- Carl/197121   49297 2022-07-31 16:37 fixlog20220731163344.log
-rw-r--r-- Carl/197121   52098 2022-07-31 16:45 fixlog20220731164141.log

## The above shows that 5 out of 8 log files are archived, leaving the latest 3 log files.
