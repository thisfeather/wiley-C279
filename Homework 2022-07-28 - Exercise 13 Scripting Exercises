Carl Tang Yong Han

Linux - Scripting Exercises:


For each activity, save your working script to a text file named as:
yourname-scripting-activity#.txt


Activity 1:
Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session â€“ they need to know:

What their username is
What the current date is
What the time is
What their current working directory is
How many files they have in that directory
What is the biggest file in their current directory

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt
_____________________________________________
#!/bin/bash

echo This is about your session
echo User Name is `logname`
echo Current Date is `date +%d-%m-%Y`
echo The time is `date +%T`
echo Current working directory is `pwd`
echo Number of files in directory: `ls | wc -l`
echo Biggest file in current directory: `du -ah . | sort -n -r | head -1`
_____________________________________________
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ./CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity1.txt 
(Outcome:)
This is about your session
User Name is ubuntu
Current Date is 28-07-2022
The time is 07:46:01
Current working directory is /home/ubuntu
Number of files in directory: 47
Biggest file in current directory: 276K ./logs


Activity 2:
Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty).
Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/scriptingExerciseAct2$ ls
Test1  Test2  Test3

Script CarlTangYongHan-scripting-activity2.txt
______________________________
#!/bin/bash

PATH=~/scriptingExerciseAct2

cd $PATH

for  file in *
do
newName="$file.`date +%Y%m%d`"
mv $file $newName
done

cd ~

### NOTE: Debugging unsuccessful, script could not run properly.


Activity 3:
You are in charge of creating a program for the lottery in your area! The options are for numbers between 1 and 50.
Create a script that picks 5 for each draw plus a bonus ball number between 1 and 10. Output the numbers to a file that has the date in its name.
Create another script that will allow users to check their lottery numbers and advise them if they match or not and how many matches they got.
