GitHub Homework 2022-07-25 - Exercise 5

Linux - Health of a Server:


1. Run a command to see all the processes running on the server owned by everyone.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -ef

2. Confirm the username you are running as.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ logname

3. Run a command to see all the processes running on the server and use grep to select only the processes your user is running.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -ef | grep "ubuntu"

4. Repeat the previous exercise. This time, select every process except things running as you.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -ef | grep -v "ubuntu"

5. Show the process info for our current session without using a grep command.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps $$

6. Show the process tree for the current session.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -f $$

7. Run a process check on the server but only output the User, pid and cmd columns to your results.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -Ao user,pid,comm

8. Run a process check to pull all of the process ids running on the server and put the output into a file named list in your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -Ao pid > ~/list

9. Run the following series of commands:

 9.1 sleep 300 &
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ sleep 300 &
 
 9.2 Find this command by checking the processes and running a grep
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ps -ef | grep "sleep 300 &"
 
 9.3 Stop the process using the process id
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ kill 30729

10. Run a command to see a dynamic view of all the processes running on your host.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ top

11. Now run the same command but specifically only for root.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ top -u root

12. Experiment with the following commands while running top and note your observations:

 - z
   (highlighting running process)
 - c
   (show absolute path of each process)
 - Shift P
   (sort results by CPU utilization)
 - k
   (kill a process by prompting for pid input)

13. Run a command to check network connectivity between your Linux session and yahoo.com.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ping yahoo.com

14. Show the network route between your session and yahoo.com and output the contents into a file named yahoo.route in your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ traceroute yahoo.com > ~/yahoo.route

15. View the file using less and see how many hops it took to get there.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cat yahoo.route | less
(19 hops)

16. Create a soft link named route to your network route.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ln -s yahoo.route route

17. Run a command to see all the network sockets on your server and output to a file named output in your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ netstat > ~/output

18. Create a folder named network in your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ mkdir network

19. Move your route file and network output file into the network folder you just created.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/network$ mv route yahoo.route output network

20. Run the command to query your network interfaces on your session.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/network$ ifconfig -a

21. Run the following command to put your results in the directory the trainer specified.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/network$ history > CarlTangYongHan.220725.module6
