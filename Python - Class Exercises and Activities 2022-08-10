### Activity 6
Using the final tuple from the previous activity, write a program that performs the following steps:
 - Display the tuple to the user.
 - Prompt the user to enter a value that should be changed.
 - Prompt the user to enter the updated value for that item.
 - Update the value and display the updated tuple to the user.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
print(newTup)
print("The above was the existing tuple. You may choose a value to change.\n")

choice = input("Please choose your item, type in exactly as seen in tuple above. ")
index = newTup.index(choice)

updatedValue = input("Now, please enter your updated value. ")

# Tuples cannot be updated directly, we have to create new tuple instead:
# Partial tuple to the left of index, if any:
if index == 0:
    leftTup = ()
else:
    leftTup = newTup[0:(index)]

onIndex = (updatedValue,)

# Partial tuple to the right of index, if any:
if index == len(newTup) - 1:
    rightTup = ()
else:
    rightTup = newTup[(index+1):]

# Combine pieces of tuples:
updatedTup = leftTup + onIndex + rightTup

print("\nHere is the updated tuple:")
print(updatedTup)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
('Albert', 'Einstein', 'Theoretical Physicist', '18 Princeton Lane', '314 Genius Drive')
The above was the existing tuple. You may choose a value to change.

Please choose your item, type in exactly as seen in tuple above. 18 Princeton Lane

#### Self-Assessment: Manipulating Collections

### Instructions:
Write a program that performs the following steps:
 - Define a tuple that contains 12 individual numbers.
 - Split the items in the tuple into three new lists, so each list includes four items from the original tuple.
 - Reverse the values in each list and display the results.
For example, if you start with the tuple (4,1,2,3,5,7,9,0,-1), you should end up with the lists [2,1,4], [7,5,3], and [-1,0,9].


## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Carl Tang Yong Han 2022-08-10

originalTuple = (3, 14, 15, 92, 65, 35, 89, 79, 2, 71, 82, 8)

print("Original tuple of 12 numbers is:\n", originalTuple)

# Splitting original tuple into 3 tuples and convert them to lists:
tup1 = originalTuple[:4]
list1 = list(tup1)

tup2 = originalTuple[4:8]
list2 = list(tup2)

tup3 = originalTuple[8:]
list3 = list(tup3)

print("\nThe three split lists are:\n", list1, list2, list3)

# Reversing the lists:
revList1 = list1[::-1]
revList2 = list2[::-1]
revList3 = list3[::-1]

# Display the results:
print("\nThe three reversed split lists are:\n", revList1, revList2, revList3)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
Original tuple of 12 numbers is:
 (3, 14, 15, 92, 65, 35, 89, 79, 2, 71, 82, 8)

The three split lists are:
 [3, 14, 15, 92] [65, 35, 89, 79] [2, 71, 82, 8]

The three reversed split lists are:
 [92, 15, 14, 3] [79, 89, 35, 65] [8, 82, 71, 2]

### Activity 4
Create a program that starts with a list of strings, identifies all the strings with
more than two characters, stores the results in another list, and displays the new list.

For example:

a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
Output:

["rye", "hello"]

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Given list of strings:
startStr = ["As", "a", "matter", "of", "fact", ", " "this", "is", "how", "it", "works", "."]

print(f"Here is the starting list of strings:\n{startStr}")

# script 2: while
# your code here
num = 100

while num <= 1000:
    if num%50 == 0:
        print(num, end=" ")
    num += 1
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 
____________________________________________



### Activity 6

# Create a script that computes the sum of all numbers between 0 and 100.
# Assuming the boundaries are included.

sum = 0
for i in range(0, 100+1):
    sum += i

print("The sum of all numbers between 0 and 100 (inclusive) is:", sum)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
The sum of all numbers between 0 and 100 (inclusive) is: 5050
____________________________________________



### Activity 7
Create a script that computes the factorial of any given number.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Take a given number from user:
given = int(input("Please enter a nonzero number (integer): "))

product = 1

for i in range(1, given + 1):
    product *= i

print(f"The factorial of your number, {given}!, is {product}.")
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
Please enter a nonzero number (integer): 21
The factorial of your number, 21!, is 51090942171709440000.
____________________________________________



### Activity 8
Starting with the defined fruit_list in the code block below, update the script to perform the following tasks.
 1. Prompt the user to enter the name of a fruit.
 2. If the fruit is in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to the user and tell the user its index value in the list.
 3. If the fruit is not in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to the user and prompt them to try again.
 4. The script should repeat itself until the user enters a stop word at the prompt.
Tip: It's always a good idea to tell the user how to end a loop!

## Answer:
____________________________________________
fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry",
"kumquat", "orange", "pineapple"]

# your code here
userInput = input("Let's start the game.\n\
Enter a fruit name.\n\
Enter S if you want to stop the game. >>>>> ").lower()

if userInput == "s":
    print("Bye!")

        userInput = input("\nSorry, your fruit is not in our list.\n\
Please try again by entering another fruit name.\n\
Enter S if you want to stop the game. >>>>> ").lower()
    else:
        index = fruit_list.index(userInput)
        print(f"\nYay, your fruit is in our list! It's at index value {index}\n")
        userInput = input("Why not try another fruit?\n\
Enter S if you want to stop the game. >>>>> ").lower()

# Making a generic solution that identifies prime numbers
# between "begin" to "final" integers
# Assuming final >= begin, and begin >= 2.
begin = 0     # Can be amended for other use case
final = 100   # Can be amended for other use case

# Existing prime numbers within range
primes = []

if final < 2:
    print("No prime number in this range.")
else:

____________________________________________



### Activity 12
Write a script that calculates the greatest common denominator between two numbers.
For example, given the numbers 18 and 27, the greatest common denominator is 9.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Get input of two integers:

num1 = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter a second integer: "))

# Temporary initiation:
GCD = None

# To find the greatest common denominator, test with numbers smaller than the lesser integer,
# and do remainder test with numbers smaller and smaller away from the lesser integer

if num1 == num2:
    GCD = num1
    print("The greatest common denominator is", GCD)
else:
    # First determine the smaller number
    if num1 < num2:
        small = num1
        big = num2
    else:
        small = num2
        big = num1
    # Test number series on both big and small numbers for remainder
    for i in range(small, 2, -1):   # Test down to 2, ignore 1.
        if (small % i == 0) and (big % i == 0):
            GCD = i
            break
            
# Summarize:
if GCD == None:
    print(f"\nThere is no common denominator between {num1} and {num2}.")
else:
    print(f"\nThe greatest common denominator between {num1} and {num2} is {GCD}.")

### Activity 13
Write a Python script that computes the frequency of each digit in a given integer.
For example, if the input number is 334, the output should be:

3 occurs 2 times
4 occurs 1 time

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Get user input of integer
userInput = input("Please enter an integer: ")

# Create a counter list for the ten digits 0 - 9:
counter = []
for i in range(10):
    counter.append(0)
    
# Checking and counting characters from input string:
length = len(userInput)

for i in range(length):
    digit = int(userInput[i])
    
    for j in range(10):
        if digit == j:
            counter[j] += 1
            break

# Produce frequency summary:
print("\nHere are the frequencies of digits in given integer:\n")

for i in range(10):
    frequency = counter[i]
    if frequency != 0:
        if frequency == 1:
            timeText = "time"
        else:
            timeText = "times"

### Activity 14
Write a script that calculates the lowest common multiple of two given integers.
For example, given the values 4 and 6, the lowest common multiple is 12.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# Get input of two integers:

num1 = int(input("Please enter a nonzero integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter a second nonzero integer: "))

# Temporary initiation:
LCM = None

# To find the lowest common multiple, test with numbers greater than the bigger integer,
# and do remainder test with numbers bigger and bigger away from the bigger integer

if num1 == num2:
    LCM = num1
    print("The lowest common multiple is", LCM)
else:
    # First determine the bigger number
    if num1 > num2:
        big = num1
        small = num2
    else:
        big = num2
        small = num1
    # Test numbers on both big and small numbers for remainder
    testNum = big
    # Test from the bigger number upwards
    while True:
        if (testNum % big != 0) or (testNum % small != 0):
            testNum += 1
        else:
            LCM = testNum
            break
            
# Summarize:
print(f"\nThe lowest common multiple between {num1} and {num2} is {LCM}.")
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running 1:

Please enter a nonzero integer: 16
Please enter a second nonzero integer: 40

The lowest common multiple between 16 and 40 is 80.
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running 2:
Please enter a nonzero integer: 66
Please enter a second nonzero integer: 33

The lowest common multiple between 66 and 33 is 66.
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running 2:
Please enter a nonzero integer: 17
Please enter a second nonzero integer: 23

The lowest common multiple between 17 and 23 is 391.
____________________________________________



### Activity 15
Write a Python script that determines if an input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
For example, the number 10 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:
  10 = 3 + 7 : both prime numbers
  10 = 5 + 5 : both prime numbers
However, the number 11 cannot be:
  11 = 1 + 10 : neither 1 nor 10 are prime numbers
  11 = 2 + 9 : 9 is not a prime number
  11 = 3 + 8 : 8 is not a prime number
  11 = 4 + 7 : 4 is not a prime number
  11 = 5 + 6 : 6 is not a prime number

## Answer:
____________________________________________
# First, create a function that can generate prime numbers that are not more than a given interger:

def primes(num):
    primeList = []
    if num < 2:
        return primeList
    else:
        primeList.append(2)
        if num == 2:
            return primeList
        else:
            # loop through the nontrivial numbers to detect primes
            for i in range(3, num+1):
                isPrime = True
                for j in primeList:
                    if i%j == 0:
                        isPrime = False
                        break
                if isPrime:
                    primeList.append(i)
            return primeList
        

# Get user input of a given number:
print("Any number smaller than the sum of the smallest prime numbers, i.e. 2 + 2 = 4,\n\
obviously won't work, therefore please only use positive integers not smaller than 4.\n")
inputInt = int(input("Please input your number for testing: >>>> "))

# Combination list (prime numbers pool) to test. Note that the boundary is inputInt - 2,
# as the larger number has to match with at least 2 to form inputInt.

primePool = primes(inputInt - 2)

print("\nWe have to check if our number can be formed by combining prime numbers from this list:")
print(primePool)

canForm = False

lenPool = len(primePool)

while lenPool > 0:
    num1 = primePool[0]
    for j in range(lenPool - 1, -1, -1):
        num2 = primePool[j]
        combine = num1 + num2
        if combine == inputInt:
            canForm = True
            print(f"\nThe number {inputInt} can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:")
            print(f"{inputInt} = {num1} + {num2}")
            # remove checked prime number from pool to reduce search space
            del primePool[j]
            lenPool = len(primePool)
            break
            
    # remove checked prime number from pool to reduce search space
    if lenPool > 0:
        del primePool[0]
        lenPool = len(primePool)

if canForm == False:
    print(f"\nThe number {inputInt} cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.")

### Activity 6
Create a new dictionary named shopping_list and add the following items to the dictionary:
 "milk" : 4,
 "butter" : 2,
 "crackers" : 1.5,
 "rice" : 2.25,
 "spaghetti" : 1.75,
 "dish soap": 3.25
Loop through each item in the list and print out each key with its price. Print the answer in this format:
 milk
 price: 4
Next, calculate how much it will cost if you purchase all the items on the list.
 - Use a variable named total_cost to store the calculated value.
 - Loop through the dictionary and add the price of each item to the total cost.
 - After looping through the dictionary, print out the total cost in a message that is meaningful to the user.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
shopping_list = {
"milk" : 4,
"butter" : 2,
"crackers" : 1.5,
"rice" : 2.25,
"spaghetti" : 1.75,
"dish soap": 3.25
}

for key in shopping_list:
    print(key)
    print("price:", shopping_list[key])

total_cost = 0

for i in shopping_list:
    total_cost += shopping_list[i]
    
print("Total cost to purchase all items in the shopping list:", total_cost)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
milk
price: 4
butter
price: 2
crackers
price: 1.5
rice
price: 2.25
spaghetti
price: 1.75
dish soap
price: 3.25
Total cost to purchase all items in the shopping list: 14.75
____________________________________________



### Activity 7
Create two dictionaries: price and quantity.
The price dictionary should be the same as the shopping_list dictionary in the previous activity:
 "milk" : 4,
 "butter" : 2,
 "crackers" : 1.5,
 "rice" : 2.25,
 "spaghetti" : 1.75,
 "dish soap": 3.25
The quantity dictionary should have the same keys, but with values that represent the number
of items to purchase rather than the price:
 "milk" : 1,
 "butter" : 1,
 "crackers" : 3,
 "rice" : 2,
 "spaghetti" : 5,
 "dish soap": 1
Write a script that loops through both dictionaries to calculate the total cost
if we purchase the indicated quantity of each item in the dictionaries.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
price = {
"milk" : 4,
"butter" : 2,
"crackers" : 1.5,
"rice" : 2.25,
"spaghetti" : 1.75,
"dish soap": 3.25
}

quantity = {
"milk" : 1,
"butter" : 1,
"crackers" : 3,
"rice" : 2,
"spaghetti" : 5,
"dish soap": 1
}

total_cost = 0

for i in quantity:
    item_cost = quantity[i] * price[i]
    total_cost += item_cost

print(f"The total cost if we purchase the indicated quantity of each item: ${total_cost}")
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
The total cost if we purchase the indicated quantity of each item: $27.0

#### Self-Assessment: Dictionaries and Sets

Create a program that does the following:
  - Define a set with at least five elements.
  - Ask the user for a value.
  - Ask the user for an operation ("add" or "remove").
  - If the operation is "remove":
    - If the value exists in the set, remove the value from the set and display the updated set to the user.
    - If the value does not exist in the set, display a user-friendly error message.
  - If the operation is "add":
    - If the value exists in the set, display a user-friendly error message.
    - If the value does not exist in the set, add the value to the set and display the updated set to the user.
  - Repeat until the user enters "quit."
  - When the user enters "quit," display the original set, the final version of the updated set,
    and the difference between the two sets.

### Activity 1
Prompt the user to answer a series of 3-5 questions about themselves
(such as their name, their age, their birthdate, or where they live) and save the answers in a list.
Display the results to the user.

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Basic Data Structures - Activity 1" above.



### Activity 2
Present the user with an existing list of items (such as the list created in the previous activity)
and prompt the user for 2-4 more items to add to the list.
Update the list with the new items and display the updated list.

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Basic Data Structures - Activity 2" above.



### Activity 3
Present the user with a list of 7-9 items (such as the list created in the previous activities)
and prompt them to enter one item to delete from the list.
Delete the named item from the list and display the updated list.

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Basic Data Structures - Activity 3" above.



### Activity 4
Present the user with a list of 7-9 items (such as the list created in the previous activities)
and prompt them to select one item from the list to update, along with the new value for that item.
Change the item's value and display the new list to the user.

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Basic Data Structures - Activity 4" above.



### Activity 5
Create four separate tuples of data.
 - One tuple with a person's first name and last name
 - A second tuple with the person's current profession
 - A third tuple with the person's current address
 - A fourth tuple with the person's previous address
Combine all tuples into a new, single tuple that contains all items from the original tuples.

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Basic Data Structures - Activity 5" above.



### Activity 6
Create a computer program that completes the following tasks:
 1. It prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
     - The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
     - After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry
       or enter another number.
 2. When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered,
    the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
     - the product of the integers
     - the average of the integers
     - the sum of the integers
     - the min of the integers
     - the max of the integers
 3. After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
     - the values the user entered
     - each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value
Do not use the built-in sum, min, or max functions.

### Activity 7
Create a computer program that identifies all the strings with more than two characters in an input list of strings and stores the results in another list.
For example:
a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
Output:
["bc", "rye", "hello"]

## Note: This is the same question as "Activities: Loops - Activity 4" above.



### Activity 8
Write a computer program using the steps below:
 1. Create a dictionary with at least three key/value pairs.
 2. Ask the user for a value.
 3. Display all key/value pairs in the dictionary that include the user-specified value.
 4. If the value does not exist in the dictionary, display a user-friendly error message.
For example:
 - dictionary: freq_count = {"hello":4,"world":4,"I":1,"am": 2,"Martha:"3"}
 - user input: 4
 - output: {"hello":4,"world":4}

## Answer:
____________________________________________
dictionary = {"Python":6, "is":2, "an": 2, "awesome": 7, \
              "programming": 11, "language": 8, "with": 4, "cool": 4, "syntax": 6}
print("This is the dictionary:\n", dictionary)

userValue = int(input("Please enter a value: >>>> "))

# select keys into a list based on user's input value
selectKeys = [k for k,v in dictionary.items() if v == userValue]

if len(selectKeys) == 0:
    print("The value you gave is not found in the dictionary")
else:
    # Make a dictionary for display:
    display = {}
    print("Here are the key/value pair(s) in the dictionary matching your specified value:\n")
    for key in selectKeys:
        display[key] = dictionary[key]
    print(display)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running 1:
This is the dictionary:
 {'Python': 6, 'is': 2, 'an': 2, 'awesome': 7, 'programming': 11, 'language': 8, 'with': 4, 'cool': 4, 'syntax': 6}
Please enter a value: >>>> 7
Here are the key/value pair(s) in the dictionary matching your specified value:

{'awesome': 7}
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running 2:
This is the dictionary:
 {'Python': 6, 'is': 2, 'an': 2, 'awesome': 7, 'programming': 11, 'language': 8, 'with': 4, 'cool': 4, 'syntax': 6}
Please enter a value: >>>> 6
Here are the key/value pair(s) in the dictionary matching your specified value:

Please enter a value: >>>> 5
The value you gave is not found in the dictionary
____________________________________________




### Activity 9
Create a program that does the following:
  1. Define a set with at least 5 elements.
  2. Ask the user for a value.
  3. Ask the user for an operation ("add" or "remove").
  4. If the operation is "remove":
    - If the value exists in the set, remove the value from the set and display the updated set to the user.
    - If the value does not exist in the set, display a user-friendly error message.
  5. If the operation is "add":
    - If the value exists in the set, display a user-friendly error message.
    - If the value does not exist in the set, add the value to the set and display the updated set to the user.
  6. Repeat until the user enters "quit."
  
## Note: This is almost the same question as "Self-Assessment: Dictionaries and Sets" above,
   except with less requirement.




#### Self-Assessment: Text Count Analysis

### Step 1: Normalize the Letter Casing
Because all content in Python is case-sensitive, start by normalizing the case
so that all characters are in the same case.
Here, we start with a string of text taken from E. Abbott's 1884 novel, Flatland (link to book).
Convert the existing text to lowercase characters, stored in a variable named s_lower.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
s = """Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons,
and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface,
but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows - only hard and with
luminous edges - and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few
years ago, I should have said "my universe": but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things."""
 
#do not change any code above this line
#your code here

s_lower = s.lower()
print(s_lower)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons,
and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface,
but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows - only hard and with
luminous edges - and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. alas, a few
years ago, i should have said "my universe": but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.
____________________________________________



### Step 2: Split the String into Words
Using the str.split() method, divide the s_lower string into separate words.
The output should be a list of strings.
Store the results in a list called words.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
words = list() #do not delete. this list must contain the list of words. 
 
# your code goes here
words = s_lower.split()
 
print(words) #do not delete 
#do not write any code past here
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
['imagine', 'a', 'vast', 'sheet', 'of', 'paper', 'on', 'which', 'straight', 'lines,', 'triangles,',
'squares,', 'pentagons,', 'hexagons,', 'and', 'other', 'figures,', 'instead', 'of', 'remaining',
'fixed', 'in', 'their', 'places,', 'move', 'freely', 'about,', 'on', 'or', 'in', 'the', 'surface,',
'but', 'without', 'the', 'power', 'of', 'rising', 'above', 'or', 'sinking', 'below', 'it,', 'very',
'much', 'like', 'shadows', '-', 'only', 'hard', 'and', 'with', 'luminous', 'edges', '-', 'and',
'you', 'will', 'then', 'have', 'a', 'pretty', 'correct', 'notion', 'of', 'my', 'country', 'and',
'countrymen.', 'alas,', 'a', 'few', 'years', 'ago,', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'said', '"my', 'universe":',
'but', 'now', 'my', 'mind', 'has', 'been', 'opened', 'to', 'higher', 'views', 'of', 'things.']
____________________________________________



### Step 3: Count the Words
Use the len method to return the number of words in the string.
At this point, for the initial string, the count should be 92; this includes duplicate instances of words.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
length = len(words)
print(f"There are {length} words in the words list.")
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
There are 92 words in the words list.
____________________________________________



### Step 4: Count the Distinct Words
Use a set to compute the number of distinct words in the string, meaning that only one instance of
each word is counted and duplicates are ignored.
At this point, for the initial string, the count of distinct words should be 75.

## Answer:
____________________________________________
wordSet = set(words)
setLength = len(wordSet)
print(f"There are {setLength} words in the words list.")
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
There are 75 words in the words list.
____________________________________________



### Step 5: Compute the Word Frequencies
The next step is to compute the frequency of the distinct words in our string.
In this step, we look at the list of words (including duplicates) and count each instance of each word.
The result will be a dictionary where the keys are the distinct words in the list and the values are the number of times each word appears in the list.
For practice, start with the list saved as w in the example code below. Some of the words in this list appear more than once,
and we need a way to identify distinct words and count their frequency.
To this end, the script should perform the following steps:
 1. Create an empty dictionary.
      - We use a dictionary here so that we can create key-value pairs where the key is the word and
        the value represents the number of times that word appears in the original list.
 2. Create a loop that does the following:
      - Look at each word in the original list and compare that word to existing keys in the dictionary.
      - If the word does not match a key in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary as a new key with the value 1.
      - If the word already exists as a key in the dictionary, the value for that key increments by 1 to count the number of occurrences of the word.
The output for the original starting list should look like this:

{'haythem': 2, 'is': 1, 'eating': 1, 'tacos.': 1, 'loves': 1, 'tacos': 1, '': 1, ':': 1}
In the results, you will notice that "tacos." is distinct from "tacos" because of the period.
Also, both the colon item and the empty item appear in the results. We will ignore punctuation for now and fix those problems in the next step.

Once you get the example above working, use the pattern to compute the frequency count
for each word in the original string s_lower.

## Answer Part 1:
____________________________________________
# we define w as a list of words 
w = ["haythem", "is", "eating", "tacos.", "haythem", "loves", "tacos", "", ":"]

# we define an empty dictionary that will hold the token/frequency key-value pair
# key:word, value:int that corresponds to the frequency of occurrence
freq_occur = dict()

#your code goes here
setW = set(w)
for word in setW:
    count = 0
    for i in w:
        if i == word:
            count += 1
    freq_occur[word] = count

print(freq_occur)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running Part 1:
{'': 1, 'eating': 1, ':': 1, 'tacos': 1, 'loves': 1, 'haythem': 2, 'tacos.': 1, 'is': 1}
____________________________________________
## Answer Part 2:
____________________________________________
word_freq = dict()

#your code goes here
for word in wordSet:
    count = 0
    for i in words:
        if i == word:
            count += 1
    word_freq[word] = count

print(word_freq)
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running:
{'ago,': 1, 'other': 1, 'figures,': 1, 'power': 1, 'surface,': 1, 'my': 2, 'countrymen.': 1,
'edges': 1, 'will': 1, 'hexagons,': 1, 'to': 1, 'sinking': 1, 'mind': 1, 'have': 2, 'views': 1,
'pretty': 1, 'like': 1, 'with': 1, 'years': 1, 'said': 1, 'the': 2, 'remaining': 1, 'but': 2,
'"my': 1, 'sheet': 1, 'been': 1, 'now': 1, 'alas,': 1, 'luminous': 1, 'opened': 1, 'freely': 1,
'of': 5, 'without': 1, 'rising': 1, 'a': 3, 'then': 1, 'which': 1, 'hard': 1, 'i': 1, 'vast': 1,
'correct': 1, 'squares,': 1, '-': 2, 'straight': 1, 'above': 1, 'about,': 1, 'you': 1, 'very': 1,

'it,': 1, 'universe":': 1, 'higher': 1, 'country': 1, 'and': 4, 'their': 1, 'instead': 1, 'in': 2,
'move': 1, 'pentagons,': 1, 'fixed': 1, 'things.': 1, 'much': 1, 'few': 1, 'should': 1, 'shadows': 1,
'has': 1, 'notion': 1, 'only': 1}
____________________________________________



### Step 6: Remove Punctuation Marks
To fix the problems caused by punctuation, we need to remove the punctuation marks from the items in the list.

Again, as a practice activity, we will start with the same list w from the previous exercise.
The existing code performs the following steps:
 1. Import the Python string module, which includes all punctuation characters.
 2. Generate a list of punctuation characters from string.punctuation and print the list to verify that it includes the characters we want to exclude from our results.
 3. Define the list we want to start with.
 4. Create a new, empty w_clean list that will hold the words after we have removed punctuation from each item in w.
Complete this script so that it looks at each item in w and performs the following tasks:
 - If the item is empty, ignore it.
 - If the item includes only a punctuation mark, ignore it.
 - If the item includes a punctuation mark as the first character or as the last character, remove that character from the word and add the cleaned word to w_clean.
 - If the item does not include punctuation, add it to the list w_clean as a separate token.
The final version of w_clean should include seven items:

['haythem', 'is', 'eating', 'tacos', 'haythem', 'loves', 'tacos']

Use the same pattern to remove the punctuation from the initial s string and count the number of times each word appears in that string.
The output should include each distinct word, regardless of case or punctuation,
along with the number of times each word appears. Also display the number of distinct words in the string.

## Answer Part 1:
____________________________________________
import string #import the string module 
#use the built-in string.punctuation method to create a list of all punctuation marks
punctuation_list =  list(string.punctuation)
#display the punctuation_list
print(punctuation_list)

w = ["haythem!", "is" ,"eating", "tacos.", ".haythem", "loves", "tacos", "", ":"]
w_clean = list()
#do not change the code above this line.

#your code goes here
for text in w:
    textLength = len(text)
    cleanText = ""
    for i in range(textLength):
        testChar = text[i]
        if testChar not in punctuation_list:
            cleanText += testChar
    if cleanText != "":
        w_clean.append(cleanText)

print(w_clean)
print(len(w_clean))
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running Part 1:
['!', '"', '#', '$', '%', '&', "'", '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', '-', '.', '/', ':', ';', '<',
'=', '>', '?', '@', '[', '\\', ']', '^', '_', '`', '{', '|', '}', '~']
['haythem', 'is', 'eating', 'tacos', 'haythem', 'loves', 'tacos']
7
____________________________________________
## Answer Part 2:
____________________________________________
import string #import the string module 
#use the string.punctuation built-in python to create a list of all punctuations
punctuation_list =  list(string.punctuation)  #do not delete this

print(words)
w_clean = list()

#your code goes here 
for text in words:
    textLength = len(text)
    cleanText = ""
    for i in range(textLength):
        testChar = text[i]
        if testChar not in punctuation_list:
            cleanText += testChar
    if cleanText != "":
        w_clean.append(cleanText)

print("\nHere is the list of cleaned-up words:\n")

print(w_clean)
print("\nWord count in this list:", len(w_clean))
____________________________________________
## Outcome of test running Part 2:
['imagine', 'a', 'vast', 'sheet', 'of', 'paper', 'on', 'which', 'straight', 'lines,', 'triangles,',
'squares,', 'pentagons,', 'hexagons,', 'and', 'other', 'figures,', 'instead', 'of', 'remaining',
'fixed', 'in', 'their', 'places,', 'move', 'freely', 'about,', 'on', 'or', 'in', 'the', 'surface,',
'but', 'without', 'the', 'power', 'of', 'rising', 'above', 'or', 'sinking', 'below', 'it,', 'very',

'my', 'mind', 'has', 'been', 'opened', 'to', 'higher', 'views', 'of', 'things.']

Here is the list of cleaned-up words:

['imagine', 'a', 'vast', 'sheet', 'of', 'paper', 'on', 'which', 'straight', 'lines', 'triangles',
'squares', 'pentagons', 'hexagons', 'and', 'other', 'figures', 'instead', 'of', 'remaining', 'fixed',
'in', 'their', 'places', 'move', 'freely', 'about', 'on', 'or', 'in', 'the', 'surface', 'but', 'without',

'only', 'hard', 'and', 'with', 'luminous', 'edges', 'and', 'you', 'will', 'then', 'have', 'a', 'pretty',
'correct', 'notion', 'of', 'my', 'country', 'and', 'countrymen', 'alas', 'a', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'i',
'should', 'have', 'said', 'my', 'universe', 'but', 'now', 'my', 'mind', 'has', 'been', 'opened', 'to',
'higher', 'views', 'of', 'things']

Word count in this list: 90
____________________________________________
#### Note: the solution in Part 2 removes all punctuations within a word, not at the boundary of the words,
     e.g. "can't" or "well-being". Though it does not affect the results in this question, the solution
     can use some improvements.



### Step 7: Put It All Together
Finally, create a single script that performs all of the following operations on the original s string.
 - Convert the string to lowercase characters.
 - Split the lowercase string into individual words.
 - Remove the punctuation from the lowercase words. Assume that all punctuation is either the first character or the last character of each item in the list.
 - Perform a count analysis on the words without punctuation characters.
 - Display the dictionary with the word counts and the number of distinct words in the original string.

#### Stretch Activity: Text Count Analysis

Once you have completed the script for this module's assignment and the script works as expected to count distinct words in a string,
try the following stretch activities:
 - Set up the script to allow the user to enter their own text at runtime and perform the operations on the user input.
 - Prompt the user for a word and return that word's frequency in a selected string.
 - Sort the items in the dictionary alphabetically.
 - Sort the items in the dictionary from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency (or vice versa).
You may need to search for examples on how to perform these activities in Python.

## Outcome of test running 1:  
### NOTE: long texts were broken up for easy reading here. Actual codes and outcomes do not break the texts.

This is text count analysis. Please get ready to input your text in one (long) string.

Please input your text. Do not press Enter until the whole string is completed:
  >>>> But good morning! Good morning to ye and thou! I’d say to all my patients,
       because I was the worse of the hypocrites, of all the hypocrites,
       the cruel and phony hypocrites, I was the very worst.
Here is the original text, 's':

But good morning! Good morning to ye and thou! I’d say to all my patients,
because I was the worse of the hypocrites, of all the hypocrites,
the cruel and phony hypocrites, I was the very worst.

The dictionary with word counts:
{'because': 1, 'good': 2, 'and': 2, 'morning': 2, 'the': 5, 'of': 2,
'i’d': 1, 'my': 1, 'worst': 1, 'i': 2, 'phony': 1, 'say': 1, 'patients': 1,
'thou': 1, 'very': 1, 'ye': 1, 'to': 2, 'hypocrites': 3, 'all': 2, 'was': 2,
'cruel': 1, 'worse': 1, 'but': 1}

Number of distinct words in the original string: 23

You may now query the frequencies of words in the text you input just now.
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> morning
The frequency of your chosen word: 2
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> Because
The frequency of your chosen word: 1
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> THE
The frequency of your chosen word: 5
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> nonexistent
The frequency of your chosen word: 0
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> hypocrites
The frequency of your chosen word: 3
Enter a word to check. Enter XXX to quit. >>>> xxx

You have chosen to quit querying.

This is the sorted dictionary in a list of tuples:

[('all', 2), ('and', 2), ('because', 1), ('but', 1), ('cruel', 1), ('good', 2),
('hypocrites', 3), ('i', 2), ('i’d', 1), ('morning', 2), ('my', 1), ('of', 2),
('patients', 1), ('phony', 1), ('say', 1), ('the', 5), ('thou', 1), ('to', 2),
('very', 1), ('was', 2), ('worse', 1), ('worst', 1), ('ye', 1)]

This is the frequency-sorted (from most to least frequencies) dictionary in a list of tuples:

[('the', 5), ('hypocrites', 3), ('all', 2), ('and', 2), ('good', 2), ('i', 2),
('morning', 2), ('of', 2), ('to', 2), ('was', 2), ('because', 1), ('but', 1),
('cruel', 1), ('i’d', 1), ('my', 1), ('patients', 1), ('phony', 1), ('say', 1),
('thou', 1), ('very', 1), ('worse', 1), ('worst', 1), ('ye', 1)]
