### Activity 1
Each of the code blocks below includes at least one error that will prevent it from running.
Fix the errors and test to make sure the code runs as expected.
Comments at the top of each block will tell you what the code should do.

_______________
Question:
# display the text in quotation marks to an output block
Print("Python is fun!")

Answer:
print("Python is fun!")

_______________
Question:
# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print("Python is fun!") print("Python is also easy.")

Answer:
print("Python is fun!\nPython is also easy.")
_______________
Question:
# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print 
("Python is fun!")

Answer:
print 
("Python is fun!")
## Note: the above code actually works to print text.
_______________
Question:
# Change each variable name to an appropriate name for Python. 
# Do not use the same variable name more than one time.
1-name = "Rebecca" # first name
&_name = "Roberts" # last name
 
# After changing the variable names, update the code below 
# to print out each name.
print(1-name)
print(&_name)

Answer:
firstName = "Rebecca" # first name
lastName = "Roberts" # last name

print(firstName)
print(lastName)
_______________




### Activity 2:
Starting with the code blocks provided below, add to the code as needed to follow
the instructions in the comments. You may add necessary code, but you should not delete
any of the existing code. Run each block to make sure it works as expected before going to the next block.
_______________
Question:
# Add a new line of code that displays the text in quotation marks 
# to an output block without repeating the text in quotation marks.
output = "I love Python!"
 
# your code below this line
print(f'"{output}"')
_______________
Question:
# Display only the text Python is fun! to an output block 
# without deleting any of the existing code
print("Python is fun!")
print("Python is also easy!")

Answer:
print("Python is fun!")
# print("Python is also easy!")
_______________




### Activity 3: Create a script that prompts the user for the name of the state
where they were born and the name of the state where they live now.
Save each value in its own variable and display the input values to the user.

_______________
# Answer:
stateBorn = input("Please enter the name of the state where you were born.")
stateLive = input("Please enter the name of the state where you live now.")

print(f"You were born in {stateBorn}, and you live in {stateLive} now.")
