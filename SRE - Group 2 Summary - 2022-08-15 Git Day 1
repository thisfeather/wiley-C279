SRE - Group 2 Summary - 2022-08-15 Git Day 1

Group 2 Team Members: Aaron Low, Britney Toh, Carl Tang


Questions:
-manage user permissions like pull push
-create individual branches to the repo
-take a main branch and commit at the same time


Experience:
- Aaron created a repo "aaron0096/GitExercise", and as the admin he gave permission to 
  Britney and Carl by their GitHub ID to push and pull to and from the repo.
  Britney initially had problem trying access the repo shared by Aaron, and met with issues of authentication.
  After resolving authentication issue with key, all three members were able to clone the repo to
  local directories and start making new files, which were eventually pushed and visible to all members on GitHub.

- Branches were created by Aaron, Britney and Carl. None were merged to main branch.
  Britney and Carl also tried deleting their own branches remotely and locally, followed by each pushing new branches remotely,
  making altogether 4 branches in the end. Carl also tried to push an update to only his new branch, but was not successful.
  Due to the late update of previous pushes, this was speculated to be due to a lag in GitHub update response,
  but refreshes of browser for GitHub proved otherwise.

- All three members made changes to local main branch and pushed to remote repo. Carl pushed first and was successful,
  whereby others members could see the update on GitHub, however when Aaron and Britney were trying to push updates from
  local main almost concurrently (with Aaron slightly preceeding Britney), Aaron was successfully pushing but Britney was
  facing an error. After a while Britney managed to push again, with changes on GitHub visible to all three members.
