Linux - Useful Scripting Tools and Linux Commands:



1. Create a variable named TEXT with the value "The number is "
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ TEXT="The number is "

2. Write a for loop that prints numbers 1-25 after printing the value of TEXT each time.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ for i in {1..25}; do echo "$TEXT$i";done
The number is 1
The number is 2
The number is 3
The number is 4
The number is 5
The number is 6
The number is 7
The number is 8
The number is 9
The number is 10
The number is 11
The number is 12
The number is 13
The number is 14
The number is 15
The number is 16
The number is 17
The number is 18
The number is 19
The number is 20
The number is 21
The number is 22
The number is 23
The number is 24
The number is 25

3. Run the same command, this time redirecting the output to a file named forloop.out.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ for i in {1..25}; do echo "$TEXT$i";done > forloop.out

4. Write a sed command that creates a new output file from forloop.out where instead of saying "the number is ", it will now say "the number is not ".
Name the file forloop2.out
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ sed 's/is /is not /g' forloop.out > forloop2.out
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cat forloop2.out 
The number is not 1
The number is not 2
The number is not 3
The number is not 4
The number is not 5
The number is not 6
The number is not 7
The number is not 8
The number is not 9
The number is not 10
The number is not 11
The number is not 12
The number is not 13
The number is not 14
The number is not 15
The number is not 16
The number is not 17
The number is not 18
The number is not 19
The number is not 20
The number is not 21
The number is not 22
The number is not 23
The number is not 24
The number is not 25

5. Try running the following if statement to get familiar with it:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ i=1
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ if(( $i==1 ))
> then
> echo "i is equal to 1"
> elif(($i==2))
> then
> echo "i is equal to 2"
> else
> echo "i is neither 1 or 2"
> fi
i is equal to 1

6. Change the value of i to be something not 1 or 2 and check that the statement works again.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ i=5
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ if(($i==1))
> then
> echo "i is equal to 1"
> elif(($i==2))
> then
> echo "i is equal to 2"
> else
> echo "i is neither 1 or 2"
> fi
i is neither 1 or 2

7. Create a variable of today's date named TODAY in the format of DD.MM.YYYY.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ DATE=`date +%d.%m.%Y`

8. Create another variable named GENDATE that has the command to generate and store the same date.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ GENDATE="DATE=`date +%d.%m.%Y`"

9. Create a file named output.log with todayâ€™s date as an extension using the variable you just created.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ touch output.log.$DATE

10. Run the history command and put the output into a file named name.YYMMDD.module1112 in the directory specified by your instructor.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ history > CarlTangYongHan.220726.module1112
