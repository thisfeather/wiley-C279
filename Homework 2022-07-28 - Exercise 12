Part 2: Review Exercise


1. Create a file named seq1.txt and write a sentence of your choice in it.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ vi seq1.txt

2. Create a file named seq2.txt and write a sentence of your choice in it.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ vi seq2.txt

3. Create a file named seq3.txt and write a sentence of your choice in it.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ vi seq3.txt

4. Generate a list of these files and add the list to another file named list.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ls seq?.txt
seq1.txt  seq2.txt  seq3.txt

5. Use a single command to copy the contents of all files with seq in the name into a file named total.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cat seq?.txt > total.txt

6. Write a single command that shows how many files you have in your current directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ ls | wc -l
43 (Output is 43 lines, i.e. 43 files in the directory)


Working with Text:


ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ vi LOTR.txt

1. Do a case-insensitive search of the file for hobbit and output the results to the screen.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ grep -i hobbit LOTR.txt 
Outcome:
It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there i
t consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his m
ind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
 Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its
 time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was
 picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.
For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

2. Put the first eight lines and the last three lines into a new file named LOTRtxt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cp LOTR.txt LOTRtxt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ vi LOTRtxt
Outcome after editing:

3. Run a command on the command line to replace all occurrences of Gollum with Thanos and output the results into a new file named LOTRMarvel.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ sed 's/Gollum/Thanos/g' LOTRtxt > LOTRMarvel.txt
Outcome:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ cat LOTRMarvel.txt

4. On the command line, run a command to compare the LOTR.txt with LOTRMarvel.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ diff -c LOTR.txt LOTRMarvel.txt

5. Change the permission on LOTR.txt so that it is read and executable for others and group, and fully accessible for the current user.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ sudo chmod 755 LOTR.txt

6. Count the number of words in LOTR.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ wc -w LOTR.txt 
473 LOTR.txt (Outcome: 473 words)

7. Rename the LOTR.txt file to LordOfTheRings.txt.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~$ mv LOTR.txt LordOfTheRings.txt

8. Create a compressed tarball named LOTR.tar.gz that includes all the files you have created in this set of exercises.
Put the relevant files in a new directory:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/LOTRdir$ ls
LOTRMarvel.txt  LOTRtxt  LordOfTheRings.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-240:~/LOTRdir$ tar -cvzf LOTR.tar.gz .
