print 
("Python is fun!")
## Note: the above code actually works to print text.
_______________
Question:
# Change each variable name to an appropriate name for Python. 
# Do not use the same variable name more than one time.
1-name = "Rebecca" # first name
&_name = "Roberts" # last name
 
# After changing the variable names, update the code below 
# to print out each name.
print(1-name)
print(&_name)

Answer:
firstName = "Rebecca" # first name
lastName = "Roberts" # last name

print(firstName)
print(lastName)
_______________




### Activity 2:
Starting with the code blocks provided below, add to the code as needed to follow
the instructions in the comments. You may add necessary code, but you should not delete
any of the existing code. Run each block to make sure it works as expected before going to the next block.
_______________
Question:
# Add a new line of code that displays the text in quotation marks 
# to an output block without repeating the text in quotation marks.
output = "I love Python!"
 
# your code below this line
print(f'"{output}"')
_______________
Question:
# Display only the text Python is fun! to an output block 
# without deleting any of the existing code

### Activity 3: Create a script that prompts the user for the name of the state
where they were born and the name of the state where they live now.
Save each value in its own variable and display the input values to the user.

_______________
# Answer:
stateBorn = input("Please enter the name of the state where you were born.")
stateLive = input("Please enter the name of the state where you live now.")

print(f"You were born in {stateBorn}, and you live in {stateLive} now.")
_______________




### Self-Assessment: Python Syntax

Requirements
Write a script that meets the following requirements:

Add your name and the current date in comments at the top of the script.
Prompt the user to enter their first name, their last name, their phone number, and the year they were born.
Save each of these values to a different variable.
Display the values they entered.
Test your script to make sure it works as expected.

### Self-Check
Use the checklist below to verify that your program meets requirements:

Your name and the current date appear at the top of the block of code.
The program includes four prompts, each of which is saved to a different variable with an appropriate name:
 - First name
 - Last name
 - Phone number
 - Year born
The program displays each of these values to the user.
There is an acceptable level of variation in setting up and designing the program's flow.
The key takeaway is that the program meets the requirements listed and runs without error.

#### Activities: Basic Python Data Types

### Activity 1
Create a computer program that performs the following steps:
 - Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.
 - Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
 - Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.
 - Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")
 - Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?
Refactor the program, using a float instead of an integer.
What happens if you enter an integer rather than a float at the prompt?


## Answer:
__________________________________
# Part 1:
userInput = input("Please enter an integer: ")
inputType = type(userInput)
print("The data type is of the input is: ", inputType)
# Converting value to integer and store as new variable
newVariable = int(userInput)
newType = type(newVariable)
print(f"The value is {newVariable} with type {newType}.")
__________________________________
## Output of test running 1:
Please enter an integer: 777
The data type is of the input is:  <class 'str'>
The value is 777 with type <class 'int'>.

## Output of test running 2:
Please enter an integer: 123.45
The data type is of the input is:  <class 'str'>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
~\AppData\Local\Temp/ipykernel_10784/1327747348.py in <module>
      5 print("The data type is of the input is: ", inputType)
      6 # Converting value to integer and store as new variable
----> 7 newVariable = int(userInput)
      8 newType = type(newVariable)
      9 print(f"The value is {newVariable} with type {newType}.")

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '123.45'

## Comment: The value in the last step is not available due to an error
## to invalidly cast a float value into an integer value.


__________________________________
# Part 2: Refactoring the program
userInput = input("Please enter a float number: ")
inputType = type(userInput)
print("The data type is of the input is: ", inputType)
# Converting value to float and store as new variable
newVariable = float(userInput)
newType = type(newVariable)
print(f"The value is {newVariable} with type {newType}.")

__________________________________
## Output of test running 1:
Please enter a float number: 34.567
The data type is of the input is:  <class 'str'>
The value is 34.567 with type <class 'float'>.

## Output of test running 2:
Please enter a float number: 89
The data type is of the input is:  <class 'str'>
The value is 89.0 with type <class 'float'>.

## Comment: There is no error message when user inputs integer in this case.
## However the value displayed is actually a float number of "89.0" instead of an integer,
## and the printed data type confirms that it is indeed converted into a float.

### Activity 2
Update the code below so that the result is equal to 576.
Do not change any of the existing values or operators or the order in which they appear.

## Question:
_________________________________
# do not change the order in which the numbers and operators appear in the next line
result = 5 + 3 ** 2 * 9 
 
print(result) # the output should be 576

## Answer:
__________________________________
result = (5 + 3) ** 2 * 9 
 
print(result) # the output should be 576
___________________________________




### Activity 3
Create a computer program that prompts the user for
a float number and returns the integer portion of the floating number.

## Answer:
___________________________________
userInput = input("Please enter a float number: ")

integerPortion = int(float(userInput))

print(f"The interger portion is: {integerPortion}")

___________________________________
## Output of test running:

The interger portion is: 234
___________________________________




### Activity 4
Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit
for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year,
and the number of years since the initial deposit.

The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula
to calculate the current value of the deposit:

V = P(1 + r/n)^nt
where
V -- value
P -- initial deposit
r -- interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05)
n -- the number of times per year interest is calculated
t -- the number of years since the initial deposit

The program should display each of the values entered to the user in a meaningful way
(so that the user can easily see what each value represents), along with the results of the calculation.

## Answer:
_________________________________
print("This program calculates the current value of a deposit.\n" \
      "Please provide the following four inputs.")

P = float(input("Please enter initial deposit, P: "))
r = float(input("Please enter interest rate (as a fraction), r: "))
n = int(input("Please enter how many times interest is calculated per year, n: "))
t = float(input("Please enter number of years since the initial deposit, t: "))

print(f"Your input:\n \
Initial deposit, P: {P} \n \
Interest rate (as a fraction), r: {r} \n \
Times per year interest is calculated, n: {n} \n \
Number of years since initial deposit, t: {t} \n")

# Calculate current value of deposit:
V = P * (1 + (r / n)) ** (n * t)

print(f"Current value of deposit: {V}")
________________________________
## Output of test running:
This program calculates the current value of a deposit.
Please provide the following four inputs.
Please enter initial deposit, P: 20000
Please enter interest rate (as a fraction), r: 0.04

### Activity 5
Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount,
the rate of interest, and the number of days for a loan and then calculates
and returns the simple interest for the life of the loan. Use the formula:

interest = principal * rate * days / 365

## Answer:
_________________________________
print("This program calculates simple interest of a loan. \
Please enter the following three values:")

principal = float(input("Principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Rate of Interest: "))
days = int(input("Number of days: "))

interest = principal * rate * days / 365

print(f"The interest is: {interest}")
________________________________
## Output of test running:
This program calculates simple interest of a loan. Please enter the following three values:
Principal amount: 40000
Rate of Interest: 0.07

#### Self-Assessment: Basic Python Data Types

Write a script that performs the following steps:

1. Collect the following individual pieces of data from the user:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - City where they live
    - Their hourly wage
    - The number of hours they work each week
2. Present the collected information based on the data input in a format like:

   Hi, Firstname Lastname! How are you?
   I hope the weather is nice in City.
   Based on the information you provided, you earn X dollars per week,
   approximately Y dollars per month, and Z dollars per year.
   
   
### Requirements:
- Add your name and the current date in a comment on the first line.
- The user can enter the text values using any case they wish,
  but the output must have only the first letter of each name and city capitalized.
   - For example, if the user enters john, JOHN, or joHn as their first name, the output should be John.
- Assume that there are four weeks in each month, but the yearly calculation should be based on a full year.
- Use correct spelling and punctuation in all user prompts and output.
Write out the code on your own and verify that it produces the expected outcome and runs without error.
Part of testing the program should include making sure that the user can enter their name and city in
any case they wish and the output will always use appropriate case.


## Answer:
___________________________________________
print("Please tell me the following information about you and your work:")

# Collect user input:
firstNameInput = input("Your first name: ")
lastNameInput = input("Your last name: ")
cityInput = input("The city where you live: ")
hourlyWageInput = input("Your hourly wage: ")
weeklyHoursInput = input("How many hours you work each week: ")

# Format conversion of user input:
firstName = firstNameInput.title()
lastName = lastNameInput.title()
city = cityInput.title()
hourlyWage = float(hourlyWageInput)
weeklyHours = float(weeklyHoursInput)


# Calculation:
weeklyWages = round((weeklyHours * hourlyWage), 2)
weeklyDollars = "{:.2f}".format(weeklyWages) # Formatting to dollars
# Approximate monthly wages:
monthlyWages = round((4 * weeklyWages), 2)
monthlyDollars = "{:.2f}".format(monthlyWages) # Formatting to dollars
annualWages = round((52 * weeklyWages), 2)
annualDollars = "{:.2f}".format(annualWages) # Formatting to dollars

# Response to user:
print(f"Hi, {firstName} {lastName}! How are you?\n\
I hope the weather is nice in {city}.\n\
Based on the information you provided, you earn {weeklyDollars} dollars per week, \
approximately {monthlyDollars} dollars per month, and {annualDollars} dollars per year.")

### Activity 2
Write a program that performs the following steps:

Ask the user if they own any cats. (Yes/No answer)
Ask the user if they own any dogs. (Yes/No answer)
If the user responses indicate that they have both cats and dogs, output "You must really love pets!"
Otherwise, the output should be "Maybe you need more pets."
The last step will apply if the user has cats but not dogs, dogs but not cats, or neither cats nor dogs.

Write two different versions of this program,
one that uses only if statements and another that uses if-else statements.

## Answer for Version 1: Using only if statements:
_____________________________________
print("Let's have a pet talk.\n\
You may answer in Y/N or Yes/No,\n\
in any capitalization format.")

# Get use input and format to uniform format.
answerCat = input("Do you own any cats? ").lower()
answerDog = input("Do you own any dogs? ").lower()

# Handle varieties of the same answer, and make booleans out of them.
if answerCat == "yes" or answerCat == "y":
    ownCat = True
elif answerCat == "no" or answerCat == "n":
    ownCat = False
    
if answerDog == "yes" or answerDog == "y":
    ownDog = True
elif answerDog == "no" or answerDog == "n":
    ownDog = False
    
# Responding to user, Version 1, using only if statements:

if ownCat and ownDog:
    print("You must really love pets!")

if ownCat and (not ownDog):
    print("Maybe you need more pets.")
    
if (not ownCat) and ownDog:
    print("Maybe you need more pets.")
    
if not (ownCat or ownDog):

### Activity 4
Write a program that uses elif to produce five different possible outcomes based on a single user input.
 1. Ask the user what season it is (fall, winter, spring, or summer).
 2. If the user enters fall, output "I bet the leaves are pretty there!"
 3. If the user enters winter, output "I hope you're ready for snow!"
 4. If the user enters spring, output "I can smell the flowers!"
 5. If the user enters summer, output "Make sure your AC is working!"
 6. If the user enters a value that does not correspond to a season, output "I don't recognize that season."
The user should be able to enter the name of the season in any case and the program will still work.

Challenge: After you have the program working as describe above, modify the program so that the user can enter either "fall" or "autumn" and get the same result.
