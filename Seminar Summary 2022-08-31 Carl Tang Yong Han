### Topic 1: Incident Management

Incident: unplanned interruption of service or reduction in quality of service.
  - hardware failure, software updates, config changes, accidental events, malicious attacks.

Incident management: raise incident (detect, log, acknowlede), fixing (assess, action, communicate),
response team (escalate? delegate?), resolve (then document and learn)

Levels of incident:
  - SEV 1: critical disruption to business, need public notification
  - SEV 2: significant impact on customer's use of the service
  - SEV 3: low impact, but need immediate attention, can escalate to SEV 2
  - SEV 4: minor issue, no impact on customers' use of service

Incident bigger than team: require multiple teams (with redundancy), higher level of communication,
control and coordination, need handoffs to team across time zones.

Incident Management Process: identify key roles & chain of command, define responsibilities,
capture response efforts for analysis and learning, communicate.
  - Note: chain of command: everyone has a single person to report to.

Good incident management: < MTTR, < losses, > communication, > MTTF, learn from failures.

Common terminology: avoid codes, acronyms, domain-specific language (for diverse response team)

Incident action planning: specified timeframe, specified incident objectives and actions to-do,
identify needed resources.

Clear communications: instant messaging, conferencing bridge, shared folders (info sharing)

Resource management: resource identification, adding subject matter experts (SMEs) to response team,
planning for additional physical or cloud-based IT resources.

Clear Chain of Command:
Incident Commander
  - work with scribe
     - Operations Lead
        - Network Ops
	- Database Ops
	- App SMEs
     - Communications Lead
     - Planning Lead

Four functional areas:
  - Incident Command: objectives, strategies, priorities, overall responsibility
  - Communications: coordinate internal & external comm, formulate messages, update comm channels.
  - Operations: arranges for resources and services, directs all ops resources.
  - Planning: tracking system changes, collect and analyze info, document follow-up tasks.

Scribe: assist IC, captures comm, actions and discussions from conference bridge.
        use visible comm tool (chatrooms, Google doc), capture all info for future use.
        Capture sufficient details to allow analysis during postmortem.
	No info sanitation, not edited to make the response appear better.

Incident commanders:
  - Selecting: self-designated initial IC, IC on-Call
  - Changing: individual discovering the incident assumes IC role until on-Call IC joins in.
              incident changes in complexity, IC needs to rest, rotation needed, follow-the-sun

Transfer of command: include thorough transfer of command briefing, notify the whole response team.

Operations lead: work with IC to develop theories of cause, recommend changes to IC, coordinate
                 ops team to restore service. Bring in SMEs to assist. NOTE: make sure that ONLY
		 ops team is making changes to the system.

Communications lead: internal & external comm. Periodic updates to status page, social media, etc.
                     may be delegated to maintain incident documentation

Planning lead: supports OL & IC, capture long-term issues, create tickets, arranging handoffs,
               tracking system divergence from SLO, ordering food for Ops team.

Service-specific Subject-Matter Expert (SME): called in to advise service-specific knowledge
                                              may not normally be involved in ops
SME on-Call Responsibilities: familiarize with other roles, join incident comms ASAP,
      offer theories and suggests, support decisions made by IC, focus on resolving incident,
      leave incident channel when asked.

Incident: When to deal with it:
  - needs immediate and dedicated effort to resolve (based on level and impact)
  - deal with it ASAP when: imminent failure to meet SLO, customer complaint
  - declare incident immediately unless fix is obvious and easy.

Impacts: who and how many impacted, service unavailable (consider dependencies), SLO/SLA violation,
         monetary (loss of income, penalties), regulatory (legal, loss of license, criminal risk).

Incident Management Checklist:
  - Acknowledge incident (initialize internal & external comm channels)
  - Research issue (triage severity, initial diagnosis, identify systems impacted, dependencies)
  - Fixable or Escalate (check for playbook, automated fix, people responsible, gather info)
  - Root cause analysis
  - Documentation (follow-up task tickets, close incident)

Closing incident: communicate,  preventive measures, key indicators to monitor,
                  documentation for future references, postmortem.

Enterprise Command Center (ECC): unified commands allows unified efforts, one voice in comm
   (for customers and public), involve executies, emphasized urgency, handles conflicting goals.




### Topic 2: Postmortem

Discussion of an incident on the why, the impact, actions taken and it's prevention for future.

- allows learning from mistake to improve systems and processes, allow team contribution
to build trust and resiliency, allow teams to continuously learn, prepare for future incidents.

- Continuous improvement: learn from past experience, increase team communication,
improve team morale.

- Ineffective type of postmortem: blameful

- Blameless postmortem: no finger-pointing and blaming, focus on improving performance and
preventing future incidents.

   - embrace risk (for learning), encourage honesty and acceptance of value (removing fear),
     share information and build a timeline.

Structure of postmortem: title, date of report, authors, incident status, incident summary,
impacts, root causes, trigger, resolution, detection, action items, lessons learned, timeline,
supporting information.

- Impact statement: internal or external? Customers lost, income lost, regulatory / legal consequence.

- Detection: who? when did it start? MTTD, and how to improve MTTD.

- Timeline: tasks completed during recovery, and MTTR.

- Root causes: go from proximate causes to root causes, to prevent re-occurence.

- (Corrective) actions: deadlines, assign responsibilities, follow-up.
   consider automation as fix, or refer to dev team.

- Build blameless culture: share postmortem reports, practice blameless postmortems,
give awards and recognition wherever due.




### Topic 3: Embracing Risk, Feedback and Fatigue

Incidents will occur, so prepare and plan for them, and practice response procedures.
High change velocity can use up error budgets fast.
Avoid purely individual efforts, work in team. On-call rotation might be needed.

Sources of failure: system complexity, security attacks, database corruption, component update.

On-call rotation: for (necessary) 24/7 service availability, consider centralize vs. global,
and minimize heroics: set proper expectation, and prevent burnouts.

Alert fatigue: common for systems at edge point
  - False positives, repeated alerting of the same issue, and alerts with seld-heal cycles.
  - too many alerts, can lead to ignored alerts.

Burnout: on-call rotation and alert fatigue lead to:
  - missed deadlines, health issues, obsession with problems, self-doubt, behavioural changes, etc.
  - result in loss of productivity or leaving.

Continuous improvement:
  - automation, documentation, toil reduction, SLO updates, update monitoring and alerts

Documentation needs updating: postmortems, engineered improvements, better procedures,
corrections discovered during practice.

Toil is low value work that can prevent higher value work.

SLO: adjusted up or down to balance business expectations and customer satisfaction.

Update monitoring: identify better SLIs, alert more accurately, provide better warning
of impending incidents.

Improve alerts: reduce false positives, improve alert info, point to likely resources,
automated ticket generation, focus on those needing immediate human intervention.
